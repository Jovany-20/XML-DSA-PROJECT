# XML DSA PROJECT

This project extends the functionality of an XML processing tool to provide advanced operations, including validation, correction, data transformation, visualization, and network analysis. The tool is designed to help developers and analysts work with XML files efficiently by combining essential features like beautifying, error correction, and data conversion with advanced capabilities like social network visualization and analysis.

## Features

### 1. Browsing XML Files
- Easily browse and load XML files for processing.
- Display the contents in a structured and readable format.

### 2. Error Detection
- Identify inconsistencies in XML files, such as:
  - Missing opening or closing tags.
  - Mismatched tags.
- Report errors with details, including line numbers and error types.

### 3. Error Correcting
- Automatically correct missing or mismatched tags.
- Save corrected XML files for future use.

### 4. Beautifying
- Format XML files with proper indentation for better readability.
- Ensure consistent formatting across all tags.

### 5. Converting XML to JSON
- Convert XML files into JSON format for seamless integration with JavaScript-based applications.
- Retain the original data structure during conversion.

### 6. Compressing XML
- Minify XML files by removing unnecessary whitespaces and indentation.
- Reduce file size using advanced data compression techniques.

### 7. Decompressing XML
- Restore compressed XML files to their original structure.
- Ensure complete data recovery during decompression.

### 8. Visualizing Followers
- Represent XML data, such as social network followers, as a graph.
- Visualize relationships between users, followers, and posts.

### 9. Post Search
- Search for specific words or topics within XML-stored posts.
- Quickly locate relevant data for analysis.

### 10. Network Analysis
- Analyze XML-based social networks to extract meaningful insights:
  - **The Most Influential User**: Identify the user with the most followers.
  - **The Most Active User**: Find the user with the most connections.
  - **Recommend Followers**: Suggest users to follow based on mutual connections.
  - **Get Mutual Friends**: Discover users who share mutual connections with specified users.
